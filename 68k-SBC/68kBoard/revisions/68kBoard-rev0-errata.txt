- the silk screen for the MOSFET is backwards (likely the symbol on the schematic has the wrong pinout)
 
- The pullup resistor for DTACK (R11) at 10k Ohms was too high, resulting in an idle voltage on DTACK that is too low.  This caused the
  CPU to read from incorrect addresses and stop after 6 cycles.  The breadboard version had a 1k Ohm pullup, but the design called for
  10k for all pullups.  It seems like ~5k is recommended for TTL circuits, but to play it safer, I installed a 2.2k, which worked, but
  later switched to a 1k.  I tried a 4.7k resistor after debugging an issue with the serial chip, and that didn't work so well, as it
  turned out.  Perhaps a better MOSFET would interfer less.

- I should have labeled all chips with their pinouts to aid in debugging.  I also should have added labels to the arduino shield

- the UDS and LDS lines were not included in the memory logic, which is fine for reads, but causes problems when writing one
  byte at a time (causing the other byte in the memory word to be replaced).  This is a very critical problem.  Fixing it would
  require another 4 OR gates to compare the LDS/UDS lines with the chip selects or write lines for each of the 4 memory chips.
  After posting in EEVBlog forums, a temporary fix would be to use a P-channel mosfet for each memory chip, or a 74LVC1G32 or
  74LVC2G32 to fix the issue.  These could be permanent solutions as well, which would require less reworking of the PCB design
  but at the expense of requiring more parts to build
