The 68k Single Board Computer
=============================

This project is aiming to create a simple single board computer using a Motorola 68000 CPU, which will connect to a host
computer via USB/Serial.  It will have a bus for connecting a supervisor arduino, but it wont be necessary for basic operation,
since it will have a UART onboard.  I may end up making a few iterations of this design.
