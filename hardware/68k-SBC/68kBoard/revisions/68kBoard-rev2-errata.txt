Revision 2 Errata and Notes
===========================

- it would have been handy if there were some power pins to hook the oscilloscope to

- there is some kind of issue with booting, where it requests addresses, 0, 4, 0, and 4, rather than 0, 2, 4, 6.  After
  investigating, it appears to be an issue with the arduino only.  Once the flash memory was programmed and booted, it
  worked perfectly.  As for the arduino, it appears to be an issue with dtack (which I recall being the reason I previously
  saw these symptoms, but it was a different cause).  It seemed to be the inserted NOPs between the dtack assertion and
  unassertion were causing it to be too slow, but removing them, while resulting in a proper initial startup, still doesn't
  boot correctly.  For the moment, I suspect it's the increased speed from 10MHz to 12MHz of the CPU which is making it too
  fast for the arduino.
