Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the footprint for the 74HC253s is too small.  I used the 16SSOP - 3.9mm wide, but the chips are
  actually 6.2mm wide.  I've tried to bend the pins under to solder them instead

- the HALT light should really be labelled RUN, since it's really ~HALT (ie. running)

- the ATA DSACK output needs to be inverted.  The input into the NAND gate should be active-low,
  but the output from the counter is going straight into the NAND input.  I'm going to try
  patching it

- (I think) the reset pin of the CompactFlash socket should be connected to the reset button, to
  ensure the card is reset.  Soft resetting seems unreliable
