* after sending the hello program and exec'ing it, it returns 1 when it should return 0
* should the pipe implementation be separate like it is?  Should it fully fill in the ops struct?  Should the vnodeops and fileops be separated?

* change the blocking/waiting code to use either of the state enums for blocking or waiting, rather than checking that the syscall is wait or waitpid
* can you change the fd allocator, such that calling it twice will return 2 different fds, even though they aren't reserved until set
  (ie. store the last allocated fd, but it has to be in the process struct)


* get exec/process arguments working
* a page allocator, to replace the use of malloc for allocating the program space
* make mallocfs able to use blocks like minix would

* what is needed to implement a 'ps' command in userspace

* there are still issues with the file sending through serial in the OS, flow control is likley not working correctly
* should you make a lib subdir, and put unistd at the top?



* syscalls to implement: pipe, dup, chdir, kill, signals, chmod, chown, access, getuid/setuid, getpid, mount/umount, rename, alarm, pause, time
* add O_TRUNC
* add file permissions checks, and uid checks
* add current working directory info.  Is that stored in the process?  Do you have to do string concat or can you pass 2 arguments to the vfs entry funcs



* add brk/sbrk/stack guard protection
* move the queue and circular buffer code to common include files somewhere (src/utils/? src/shared/?)
* a slab allocator would maybe help, but I don't think it's as important at the moment

* there is an issue with load scripts that are an odd number of bytes, and the last byte wont be read/written because the loader operates on words
* can you make the kernel relocatable again?
* rewrite the math functions to use fewer registers (this ain't a risc processor)
* you need some tests, but ideally it would use a simple emulator.  Maybe easy68k or something could be used


68k Single Board Computer:

	* in seems like AS in the interrupt ack is not necessary.  It can acknowledge the interrupt fine without it
	* a counter is not strictly needed for memory
	* add interrupt logic to schematic and pcb
	* you need a proper reset circuit that slowly turns it on through a cap?

	* if you have interrupts, and you connect at least one button to one of the IP change interrupts, then you could use the button for breaking into a debugger?
	* how can you modify the design to be better for debugging, possibly without an arduino.  Can you have step debugging through a hardware button, so that the bus
	  can be inspected?
	* can you have an debugger in the monitor software?  There are trap and breakpoint instructions in the processor for debugging, so if you define an interrupt handler
	  for those, you could have it enter a debugger, that possibly allows single stepping?  I'm not sure how to implement that

	* do I need optoisolators for the ftdi?  There is a blip where the arduino resets when the serial converter is connected

	* can you add a video/lcd expansion via the expansion connector?  Maybe you could get ends to directly connect it?  Would it be via parallel interface?
	  would you need a PIT 68230 to interface?  How complex are the interfaces of those graphic ones?
	* can you connect an esp01 as a wifi device?  I suppose you could connect it to the other serial port, even though it would be slow.  Is there another
	  way to get ethernet or wifi?

68k Arduino Shield:
	* need labels next to all pins
	* there's no way to reset the arduino with the shield on
	* there should be pins on the shield for anything not wired to the arduino directly, so that it can be plugged into despite ribbon cables being used
	* there should be a way on the arduino shield to enable, disable, or change the arduino's memory space



* it might be possible to do a 68030 single board computer, with 74LVC244/245 interfaces to an fpga chip, to provide the glue logic, but it would be a
  lot of surface mount chips, so you'd have to try a few smaller surface mount projects first
* make a surface mount/PLCC version of the 68k-SBC board to test SMT, since the design should work, and some of the memory chips are available as SMT
