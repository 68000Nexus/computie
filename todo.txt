Post:
	* I need to elaborate on how I did things, what broke, how I fixed it...  It's a bit too much a list of what I did rather than something helpful

Monitor:

	* failure vectors don't point to the correct addresses, from the looks of it

	* can you have an debugger in the monitor software?  There are trap and breakpoint instructions in the processor for debugging, so if you define an interrupt handler
	  for those, you could have it enter a debugger, that possibly allows single stepping?  I'm not sure how to implement that


k30-SBC:
	* you could use the extra 2-4 decoder for onboard I/O within IOSEL (ie. MC68681 would remain the same, ATA I/O would be moved to 0x700100, and two more devices could be added
	* is 16 clocks enough for the BERR?  It should be 480us which should be enough
	* look into the CIIN signals and stuff


68k Single Board Computer:

	* can you add a video/lcd expansion via the expansion connector?  Maybe you could get ends to directly connect it?  Would it be via parallel interface?
	  would you need a PIT 68230 to interface?  How complex are the interfaces of those graphic ones?
	* can you connect an esp01 as a wifi device?  I suppose you could connect it to the other serial port, even though it would be slow


68k Arduino Shield:
	(nothing atm)


68k SMT:
	(nothing atm)


* should you move the Z80 project into it's own repo?
