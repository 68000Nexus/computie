* DTACK assert/de-assert is driving the output, but you'd need to turn it into an input to make it act as an open collector.
  Currently it has positive logic because the breadboard version has a mosfet acting as an open collector output for the arduino's pin

* do I need optoisolators for the ftdi?

* you need a proper reset circuit that slowly turns it on through a cap
* add an interrupt acknowledge signal (FC0:2 = 111)
