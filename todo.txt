* should the buttons be put onto the pin change inputs (IP2/IP3), and the bus pins have IP4/IP5???  It would provide some debounce.  What else
  could you use it for though...

* do I need optoisolators for the ftdi?

* you need a proper reset circuit that slowly turns it on through a cap
* add an interrupt acknowledge signal (FC0:2 = 111)
